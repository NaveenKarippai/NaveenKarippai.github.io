### ELI5 Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that works without a central bank and can be sent from a user to another user without a third-party intermediary. BTC is the abbreviation for Bitcoin currency similar to USD for the US Dollar. Essentially, you own a Bank in your own pocket when you use Bitcoin. Bitcoin exists only in a digital form unlike the paper form of traditional currencies like USD, EURO. The Bitcoin network is powered by bitcoin nodes spread across the Earth making it a decentralized currency. The Bitcoin transactions are immutable i.e., Bitcoin sent to a user cannot be reverted after a certain number of confirmation blocks. The key advantages of using Bitcoin are its low transaction fees and relatively faster transaction time. There are numerous forks of Bitcoin known as Altcoins.


### Learning path

I shall share the resources that I used to learn about Bitcoin and its technology in this micro article.

* Bitcoin is a digital currency. So, I decided to learn what money is  

     I found the youtube series named '[The Hidden Secrets of Money](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc)' by Mike Maloney to be very helpful.

* The creation of Bitcoin was motivated by the financial crisis of 2008. Back then I did not know much about it

    I decided to do some research about the 2008 crisis and found this interesting movie named [The Big Short | imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/). This was very insightful.

* Learning from online videos can sometimes be intuitive

    There is a youtube channel by [Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop/videos). I highly recommend his channel if you want to keep yourself updated on Bitcoin technology.

* You are into learning from books and is interested in fundamental analysis of Bitcoin and its technology
  
   I recommend the book named '[Cryptoassets](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoassets-Innovative-Investors-Bitcoin-Beyond/dp/1260026671/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=cryptoassets&qid=1578238797&sr=8-1)' by Chris Burniske.  If I recall correctly, this book is not strictly covering the technical aspect of Bitcoin but skims through some of the underlying technology and various components in the Bitcoin ecosystem. I believe that having broad knowledge is always useful and hence mentioning it here.

* Technical book on Bitcoin
   
   [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) by Andreas Antonopoulos is one of the best technical books I have read on Bitcoin technology.

* Technical book on Ethereum or Altcoins
  
    [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) by Andreas Antonopoulos dives deep into the smart contract platform Ethereum.

* Online forums for discussions

    There are many telegram channels and subreddits for discussions on Bitcoin or Altcoins (WARNING: too many scams) but I found [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/) to be the most useful.

* Educational video courses

    [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=blockchain) has some very good courses on Bitcoin technology.

* DIY weekend project

  Try to play around with Ethereum or other Bitcoin technology. Making a smart contract on the testnet might give you further insights into how things work and help break the analysis paralysis.


### Summary

Bitcoin technology solves some real-world problems. It is not a silver bullet but knowing the Bitcoin technology can be very helpful for a Software Engineer. 

Good luck!!
