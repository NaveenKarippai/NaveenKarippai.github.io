### A Very Short Introduction

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that works without a central bank that can be sent from user to user without a third-party intermediary. Essentially, you own a Bank in your own pocket when you use Bitcoin. Bitcoin exists only in a digital form unlike the paper form of traditional currencies like USD, EURO. The Bitcoin network is powered by bitcoin nodes spread across the Earth and thus named a decentralized currency. The Bitcoin transactions are immutable and it means that Bitcoin sent to a user cannot be reverted after a certain number of confirmation blocks.

### The inception

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by a person or a group of persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto. According to the resources, the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent inflation was the inspiration to create Bitcoin. The genesis block was mined on January 3rd, 2009. If you are interested to know further, you could read the Bitcoin whitepaper [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). The Bitcoin technology relies on cryptography and hence the term 'cryptocurrency' is also interchangeably used. The major problem solved by Bitcoin technology is known as the double-spending issue. To describe double-spending in layman's terms, you cannot create unique copies in the digital world. For example, if you visit the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam, you could see the wonderful paintings by the great artist in physical form. There may be many replicas in the market but the original one can be identified and is tagged highly valuable or expensive. This uniqueness or the ability to distinguish from a replica does not exist in the digital world. If you have a picture in digital form (imagine the picture was created in digital form), multiple copies of it can be easily made and there is nothing as original anymore.

### Characteristics of Money

1. portable

It should be easy to transport or move. The traditional currencies like EURO or USD can be carried either as paper currency or in digital form backed by Banks.


2. durable

It should withstand time. At the start of civilization, man used cattle as a form of money and this is not something which can withstand time. 


3. divisible

There should be smaller units for the sake of convenience. For example, the EURO has cents. 1 EURO = 100 Cents


4. recognizable

It should be easy to verify the authenticity of the currency. You basically trust the traditional currencies because it is backed by the Government and the Central Bank 


5. fungible

Fungible means interchangeable. You have two '1 EURO' coins in your pocket, and you be should be able to buy the same amount of potato chips with either of these coins.


6. scarce

Supply-Demand drives the market and defines the value for money. If there is an infinite amount of money in circulation, it declines the value of money.


7. difficult to counterfeit 

It should not be easily faked.



### Characteristics of Bitcoin

1. portable

Bitcoin exists in digitial form. In 2020, you could find a smartphone in everyone's hands. You could easily use Bitcoin if you have a smartphone.


2. durable

The chain of blocks in Bitcoin are immutable. It can withstand a long long time frame.


3. divisible

The smallest unit of Bitcoin is called a Satoshi. 1 Bitcoin = 10^8 Satoshis


4. recognizable

There are plenty of transaction explorers or wallets that allows to easily verify a Bitcoin transaction. You trust the Bitcoin technology.


5. fungible

Satoshis or Bitcoin are interchangeable.


6. scarce

There can only be a total of approx 21 million Bitcoins. The inflation rate decreases with every bitcoin halving (happens every 4 years)


7. difficult to counterfeit

Bitcoin uses asymmetric cryptography and is supposed to be very secure. One could easily verify the transactions.


#### Summary

Bitcoin abides by the characteristics of Money.
